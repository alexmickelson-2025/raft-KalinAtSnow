1  given a node when it starts up then it should be a follower
2  given a node is a follower when it recieves a vote notice then it should vote
3  given a node is a follower when it recieves a second vote notice then it should not vote
4  given a node is a follower when it recieves a heartbeat notice then it should update its election timeout
5  given a node is a follower when it hasn't recieved a heartbeat in its election timeout then it starts an election and turns to a candidate, incrementing its term count
6  given a node is a candidate when it hasn't been elected then it votes for itself and asks others for a vote
7  given a node is a candidate when it hasn't been elected and it recieves a notice that there is another leader with a higher term count then it reverts to a follower 
8  given a node is a candidate when a designated time passes then it times out and reverts to a follower 
9  given a node is a candidate when it recieves majority vote then it becomes a leader
10 given a node is a candidate when it receives a appendEntries from the old leader and the term in the request is as large as teh current term, then it continues to append and is follower
11 given a node is a follower when it recieves an instruction followed by a vote then the instruction executes first
12 given a node is a follower when it recieves an instruction that would overwrite an old instruction then it ignores the request
13 given a node is a follower when it receives an instruction from a node claiming to be leader but has a lower termcount  then it ignores the request
14 given a node is a leader when it recieves an ammend entry from anohter leader with a higher term count then it converts to a follower
15 given a node is a follower and it has a larger log length than the leader when it recieves an ammend entry from a leader then it returns false
16 given a node is a leader and sends out an ammend entry when the response is returned and is false then resend the ammend entry back a level
17 given a node is a leader and sends out an ammend entry when the majority respond true then commit the log to true

considerations
leaders should never overwrite or delete logs
thread safe
random election timeouts
if client contacts follower, redirect to leader
majority always is needed for anything but converting to follower and candidate
